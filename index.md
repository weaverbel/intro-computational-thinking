#### Topic and aims

Once you have completed this introductory workshop on computational thinking, you should be able to:

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable parts
- Develop a series of steps (also known an algorithm) to solve a problem
- Use abstraction to make the steps re-usable

#### Audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers at all career stages who want to understand both the uses and the building blocks of computational thinking, a skill that is useful for all kinds of problem solving, whether in real life or in computing. The workshop will not teach you computer programming. Instead it will cover the thought processes involved if you want to learn to program. 

#### Prerequisites

A pen and paper is all you will need to complete this workshop. All the practice exercises can be done without a computer.

#### Assumed knowledge

No prior knowledge is assumed. Use the [glossary](4-glossary.md) to familiarise yourself with the meaning of terms like abstraction and algorithm.
